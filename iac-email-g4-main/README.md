# IAC EMAIL GROUP 4
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and implementation of Infrastructure as Code (IAC) using Terraform and Ansible for deploying and configuring AWS infrastructure. The main focus of this project is to streamline the deployment process, enhance scalability, and improve overall performance while reducing manual intervention and ensuring consistency across environments.


## Business Rationale for New Feature
### Importance of Infrastructure Automation
As businesses grow and evolve, the demand for scalable, reliable, and efficient infrastructure becomes increasingly crucial. Manual infrastructure provisioning and configuration are prone to errors, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies. Therefore, automating these processes using IAC tools like Terraform and Ansible can significantly improve operational efficiency, reduce downtime, and enhance agility.

### Need for Streamlined Deployment
In the previous setup, the deployment process involved manual configuration of AWS EC2 instances and RDS databases, which was time-consuming and error-prone. By implementing IAC, we aim to streamline this process by defining infrastructure configurations as code, enabling rapid and consistent deployment of resources.
### Enhanced Performance and Scalability
With the new infrastructure setup, we expect improved performance and scalability. By optimizing resource allocation and leveraging automation, we can ensure that the application runs efficiently, even under high loads. Additionally, the ability to quickly scale resources up or down based on demand ensures a seamless user experience.

## Success Metrics
### Metrics for Evaluating Success
- Deployment Time: Measure the time taken to deploy infrastructure using IAC compared to manual deployment methods. A significant reduction in deployment time indicates improved efficiency.
- Error Rate: Monitor the occurrence of errors or misconfigurations in the deployed infrastructure. A decrease in error rate signifies improved reliability and consistency.
- Scalability: Evaluate the ability of the infrastructure to handle increased loads by monitoring performance metrics such as response time, throughput, and resource utilization.
- Cost Savings: Measure the cost savings achieved through optimized resource allocation and reduced manual effort. This can be assessed by comparing the infrastructure costs before and after implementing IAC.

### Cost Estimate
The cost of building and maintaining the infrastructure automation solution includes:

- Development Time: Time spent on designing, implementing, and testing Terraform and Ansible scripts.
- Tooling Costs: Subscription fees for cloud services (e.g., AWS) and automation platforms (e.g., Terraform Cloud, Ansible Tower).
- Training and Education: Investment in training resources to upskill team members on IAC tools and best practices.
- Maintenance and Support: Ongoing maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting of the automation scripts and infrastructure.

## Cost Savings
While the initial implementation cost may be significant, the long-term benefits and cost savings justify the investment. By automating infrastructure deployment and management, businesses can reduce operational overhead, minimize downtime, and optimize resource utilization, leading to overall cost savings and improved ROI.

- Ansible Folder: Contains playbooks for installing Docker and Docker Compose on the EC2 instance after Terraform provisioning.
- Terraform Folder: Contains modules for deploying AWS EC2 instances and RDS MySQL databases. The modules are organized for modularity and reusability.
### Workflow Summary
1. Terraform Deployment: Use Terraform commands to provision and configure AWS infrastructure, including EC2 instances and RDS databases.
2. Ansible Configuration: After Terraform provisioning, execute Ansible playbooks to install Docker, Docker Compose and sign up in GitHub Container Registry on the EC2 instance ensuring the environment is ready for application deployment.

## Summary
Infrastructure as Code (IAC) implementation with Terraform and Ansible offers numerous benefits for businesses, including streamlined deployment, enhanced performance, and cost savings. By automating infrastructure provisioning and management, organizations can achieve greater efficiency, scalability, and agility in their operations. Regular monitoring and optimization are essential for maximizing the effectiveness of the implemented solution and ensuring ongoing success.
